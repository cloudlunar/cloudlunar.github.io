## Introduction
**Flame** is a simple game created by my friends and me in the 2016 ZQ hackday held by [Ziqiang Studio](http://ziqiang.studio). The core mechanism of the game is simply burning ropes. 
The game is still in the early development. You can download the hackday demo version to have a try. Enjoy it.
