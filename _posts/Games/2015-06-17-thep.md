>***Notice***
>This is an **experimental** game. Due to many early problems in design, it is difficult for me to finish it and bring the gameplay come to an end. As a result, the project has been obsoleted.
>As far, I have finished about 30-60 minutes game contents. Through big bugs have been fixed, there are still many uncomfortable points in the game. If you are still interested in having a try, you can download and play it from this page for free.
